first you need to install python libraries and ngrok from offical website

```bash
pip install pyfiglet==0.7
pip install colorama
pip install Flask
pip install flask-ngrok
pip install pymongo
pip install pygame
pip install numpy
pip install numba
pip install opencv-python
```
After open text editor(or your ide). Open main.py file. 
You also need mongodb database to store all logins and passwords
connect your mongodb database to main.py.
it's not to hard I commented lines were you need to write.

# Note

The login page front end is not working properly on mobile devices 
So I will update the frontend soon
